            Momentum will use Services Australia to check if you qualify for a concession, rebate or service. In doing
            so, Momentum may share your information and access information about you held by Centrelink or the
            Department of Veteran Affairs. This includes personal information like your name, address, payment and
            concession details. Once given, your consent is only valid while youâ€™re with Momentum, and can be withdrawn
            by contacting them or Services Australia (although this may make you ineligible for the concession or
            rebate).
