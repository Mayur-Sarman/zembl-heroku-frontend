                Momentum will use Services Australia to check if you qualify for a concession, rebate or service. In
                doing so, Momentum may share your information and access information about you held by Centrelink or the
                Department of Veteran Affairs. This includes personal information like your name, address, payment and
                concession details. Once given, your consent is only valid while youâ€™re with Momentum, and can be
                withdrawn by contacting them or Services Australia (although this may make you ineligible for the
                concession or rebate).

                information and share it with Momentum?
